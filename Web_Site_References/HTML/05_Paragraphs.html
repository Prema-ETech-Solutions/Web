      Gates was born and raised in Seattle, Washington. In 1975, he co-founded
      Microsoft with childhood friend Paul Allen in Albuquerque, New Mexico. It
      went on to become the world's largest personal computer software
      company.[4][a] Gates led the company as chairman and CEO until stepping
      down as CEO in January 2000, but he remained chairman and became chief
      software architect.[7] During the late 1990s, he had been criticized for
      his business tactics, which have been considered anti-competitive. This
      opinion has been upheld by numerous court rulings.[8] In June 2006, Gates
      announced that he would be transitioning to a part-time role at Microsoft
      and full-time work at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the private
      charitable foundation that he and his wife, Melinda Gates, established in
      2000.[9] He gradually transferred his duties to Ray Ozzie and Craig
      Muncie.[10] He stepped down as chairman of Microsoft in February 2014 and
      assumed a new post as technology adviser to support the newly appointed
      CEO Satya Nadella.[11] In March 2020, Gates left his board positions at
      Microsoft and Berkshire Hathaway to focus on his philanthropic endeavors
      including climate change, global health and development, and
      education.[12]

      Gates was born in Seattle, Washington, on October 28, 1955.[3] He is the
      son of William H. Gates Sr.[b] (1925–2020) and Mary Maxwell Gates
      (1929–1994).[20] <br>His ancestry includes English, German, and
      Irish/Scots-Irish.[21] His father was a prominent lawyer, and his mother
      served on the board of directors for First Interstate BancSystem and the
      United Way of America. Gates's maternal grandfather was J. W. Maxwell, a
      national bank president. Gates has an older sister Kristi (Kristianne) and
      a younger sister Libby. He is the fourth of his name in his family but is
      known as William Gates III or "Trey" (i.e., three) because his father had
      the "II" suffix.[22][23] The family lived in the Sand Point area of
      Seattle in a home that was damaged by a rare tornado when Gates was seven
      years old.[24]
