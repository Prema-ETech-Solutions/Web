<!-- HTML Documents -->

<!-- All HTML documents must start with a document type declaration: <!DOCTYPE html>.

The HTML document itself begins with <html> and ends with </html>.

The visible part of the HTML document is between <body> and </body>. -->
<!-- 
The <!DOCTYPE> Declaration
The <!DOCTYPE> declaration represents the document type, and helps browsers to display web pages correctly.

It must only appear once, at the top of the page (before any HTML tags).

The <!DOCTYPE> declaration is not case sensitive.

The <!DOCTYPE> declaration for HTML5 is: -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Document</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- HTML Headings

<h1> defines the most important heading. <h6> defines the least important heading:  -->
    <h1>TAG H1</h1>
    <h2>TAG H2</h2>
    <h3>TAG H3</h3>
    <h4>TAG H4</h4>
    <h5>TAG H5</h5>
