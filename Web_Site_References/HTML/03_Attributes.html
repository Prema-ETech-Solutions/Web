        2. Relative URL - Links to an
        image that is hosted within the website. Here, the URL does not include the
        domain name. If the URL begins without a slash, it will be relative to the
        current page. Example: src="img_girl.jpg". If the URL begins with a slash,

          attribute, or if the user uses a screen reader. -->
