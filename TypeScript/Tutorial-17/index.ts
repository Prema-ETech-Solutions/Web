// Explanation:
// Abstract Class (Shape):

// An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated directly. It is meant to be subclassed by other classes.
// The Shape class in this example is an abstract class that provides a blueprint for other shapes. It contains both abstract and non-abstract methods.
// Abstract Method (calculateArea):

// The calculateArea method is declared as an abstract method using the abstract keyword. This means that any subclass of Shape must implement this method.
// Abstract methods do not have a body in the abstract classâ€”they are intended to be overridden by derived classes.
// Non-Abstract Method (describe):

// The describe method is a regular method (non-abstract) within the Shape class. It provides a common functionality that can be used by all subclasses of Shape.
// This method is available to all instances of classes that extend Shape.
// Derived Classes (Circle and Rectangle):

// Both Circle and Rectangle extend the abstract class Shape and must implement the calculateArea method.
// Each class provides its own implementation of the calculateArea method based on the specific shape's properties.
// Instantiation:

// You cannot create an instance of an abstract class directly (new Shape() would result in an error).
// Instead, you create instances of classes that extend the abstract class (new Circle(radius) and new Rectangle(width, height)).
// Key Points:
// Abstract classes are used to define a common base class with abstract methods that must be implemented by derived classes.
// Abstract classes can also contain non-abstract methods that provide shared functionality across subclasses.
// Abstract methods serve as a template for subclasses, ensuring that certain methods are implemented by any derived class.
// This example demonstrates the concept of abstract classes and methods in TypeScript, showing how they enforce a common structure while allowing for specific implementations in derived classes.
