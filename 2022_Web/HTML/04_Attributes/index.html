    The lang Attribute
    You should always include the lang attribute inside the <html> tag, to declare the language of the Web page. This is meant to assist search engines and browsers.

    The following example specifies English as the language:



    Country codes can also be added to the language code in the lang attribute. 
    So, the first two characters define the language of the HTML page, and the last two characters define the country.

    The following example specifies English as the language and United States as the country:
-->
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Forth Page</title>
</head>
<body>

        HTML attributes provide additional information about HTML elements.

        HTML Attributes
        All HTML elements can have attributes
        Attributes provide additional information about elements
        Attributes are always specified in the start tag
        Attributes usually come in name/value pairs like: name="value"
        The href Attribute
        The <a> tag defines a hyperlink. The href attribute specifies the URL of the page the link goes to:
    -->
    <a href="https://github.com/Premdangle">Visit My Github</a><br>
    <a href="https://github.com/Prema-ETech-Solutions">Visit My Company Github</a><br>
    <a href="https://github.com/Sparkztech">Visit Our Company  Github</a><br>



    <!-- 
        The src Attribute
        The <img> tag is used to embed an image in an HTML page. The src attribute specifies the path to the image to be displayed:
    -->
    
    <img src="..//02_Basic/img/html.png"><br>
    
    <!--  
        There are two ways to specify the URL in the src attribute:
        
        1. Absolute URL - Links to an external image that is hosted on another website. Example: src="https://www.w3schools.com/images/img_girl.jpg".
        
        Notes: External images might be under copyright. If you do not get permission to use it, you may be in violation of copyright laws. In addition, you cannot control external images; it can suddenly be removed or changed.
        
        2. Relative URL - Links to an image that is hosted within the website. Here, the URL does not include the domain name. If the URL begins without a slash, it will be relative to the current page. Example: src="img_girl.jpg". If the URL begins with a slash, it will be relative to the domain. Example: src="/images/img_girl.jpg".
        
        Tip: It is almost always best to use relative URLs. They will not break if you change domain.

    <!--  
        The width and height Attributes
        The <img> tag should also contain the width and height attributes, which specifies the width and height of the image (in pixels):
    -->
    <img src="..//02_Basic/img/html.png" width="100" height="100"><br>


    <!--  
        The alt Attribute
        The required alt attribute for the <img> tag specifies an alternate text for an image, 
        if the image for some reason cannot be displayed. This can be due to slow connection, 
        or an error in the src attribute, or if the user uses a screen reader.
    -->
    
    <h2>The alt Attribute</h2>
    <p>The alt attribute should reflect the image content, so users who cannot see the image gets an understanding of what the image contains:</p>
    <img src="../02_Basic/img/html.png" alt="HTML IMG" width="500" height="600"><br>

    <!--  
        See what happens if we try to display an image that does not exist:
    -->
    <img src="../02_Basic/img/html_.png" alt="Girl with a jacket">

    <p>If we try to display an image that does not exist, the value of the alt attribute will be displayed instead. </p><br>







    <!--  
        The style Attribute
        The style attribute is used to add styles to an element, such as color, font, size, and more.
    -->
    <p style="color:red;">This is a red paragraph.</p><br>


    <!--  
        The title Attribute
        The title attribute defines some extra information about an element.
            
        The value of the title attribute will be displayed as a tooltip when you mouse over the element:
    -->
    <p title="I'm a tooltip">This is a paragraph.</p>
    <!--  
        We Suggest: Always Use Lowercase Attributes
        The HTML standard does not require lowercase attribute names.

        The title attribute (and all other attributes) can be written with uppercase or lowercase like title or TITLE.

        However, W3C recommends lowercase attributes in HTML, and demands lowercase attributes for stricter document types like XHTML.
