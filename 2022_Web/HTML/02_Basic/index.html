       In this chapter we will show some basic HTML examples.
       Don't worry if we use tags you have not learned about yet. 


        HTML Documents
        All HTML documents must start with a document type declaration: <!DOCTYPE html>.
        The HTML document itself begins with <html> and ends with </html>.
    -->

    <!--  
        The <!DOCTYPE> Declaration
        The <!DOCTYPE> declaration represents the document type, and helps browsers to display web pages correctly.
        It must only appear once, at the top of the page (before any HTML tags).
        The <!DOCTYPE> declaration is not case sensitive.    
        The <!DOCTYPE> declaration for HTML5 is:
    -->

    <!--  
        HTML Headings
        HTML headings are defined with the <h1> to <h6> tags.
        <h1> defines the most important heading. <h6> defines the least important heading:         
    -->
    <h1>h1</h1>
    <h2>h2</h2>
    <h3>h3</h3>
    <h4>h4</h4>
    <h5>h5</h5>
    <h6>h6</h6>
    

    <!--  
        HTML Paragraphs
        HTML paragraphs are defined with the <p> tag:
    -->
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
    <p>This is another paragraph.</p>

    <!--  
        HTML Links
        HTML links are defined with the <a> tag:
    -->
    <a href="https://github.com/Prema-ETech-Solutions">This is a link</a>
    <!--  
        The link's destination is specified in the href attribute. 
        Attributes are used to provide additional information about HTML elements.
        You will learn more about attributes in a later chapter.
    -->


    <!--  
        HTML Images
        HTML images are defined with the <img> tag.
        The source file (src), alternative text (alt), width, and height are provided as attributes:        
    -->
    <br>
    <img src= "./img/html.png" alt="HTML5" width="100" height="100">
</body>
</html>
