        HTML comments are not displayed in the browser, but they can help document your HTML source code.

        HTML Comment Tag
        You can add comments to your HTML source by using the following syntax:
    -->
    <!-- Write your comments here -->
    <!--  
        Add Comments
        With comments you can place notifications and reminders in your HTML code:
    -->
    <!-- This is a comment -->
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
    <!-- Comments are not displayed in the browser -->

    <!--  
        Hide Content
        Comments can be used to hide content.

        Which can be helpful if you hide content temporarily:
    -->
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>

    <!-- <p>This is another paragraph </p> -->
    
    <p>This is a paragraph too.</p>

    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
    <!--
    <p>Look at this cool image:</p>
    <img border="0" src="pic_trulli.jpg" alt="Trulli">
    -->
    <p>This is a paragraph too.</p>

    <!--  
        Hide Inline Content
        Comments can be used to hide parts in the middle of the HTML code.
    -->
    <p>This <!-- great text --> is a paragraph.</p>
