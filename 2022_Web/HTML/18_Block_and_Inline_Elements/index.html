    <h1>Block-level Elements</h1>
    <pre>
        
        A block-level element always starts on a new line, and the browsers automatically add some space (a margin) before and after the element.
        
        A block-level element always takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).
        
        Two commonly used block elements are: p and div.
        
        The p element defines a paragraph in an HTML document.
        
        The div element defines a division or a section in an HTML document.
    </pre>

    <p style="border: 1px solid black">Hello World</p>
    <div style="border: 1px solid black">Hello World</div>

    <p>
      The P and the DIV elements are both block elements, and they will always
      start on a new line and take up the full width available (stretches out to
      the left and right as far as it can).
    </p>

    <h2>Inline Elements</h2>
    <pre>

        An inline element does not start on a new line.
        
        An inline element only takes up as much width as necessary.
        
        This is a span element inside a paragraph.
    </pre>

      The SPAN element is an inline element, and will not start on a new line
      and only takes up as much width as necessary.

    <h2>div Element</h2>
    <pre>
        The div element is often used as a container for other HTML elements.

            The div element has no required attributes, but style, class and id are common.
            
            When used together with CSS, the div element can be used to style blocks of content:
    </pre>
    <div style="background-color: black; color: white; padding: 20px">
      <h2>London</h2>
      <p>
        London is the capital city of England. It is the most populous city in
        the United Kingdom, with a metropolitan area of over 13 million
        inhabitants.
      </p>
      <p>
        Standing on the River Thames, London has been a major settlement for two
        millennia, its history going back to its founding by the Romans, who
        named it Londinium.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h2>    
        The span Element
    </h2>
    <pre>
        The span element is an inline container used to mark up a part of a text, or a part of a document.
        The span element has no required attributes, but style, class and id are common.
        When used together with CSS, the <span> element can be used to style parts of the text:
    </pre>

    <h1>The span element</h1>

    <p>My mother has <span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold">blue</span> eyes and my father has <span style="color:darkolivegreen;font-weight:bold">dark green</span> eyes.</p>
