    What is an HTML Element?
    An HTML element is defined by a start tag, some content, and an end tag:

    <tagname> Content goes here... </tagname>
    The HTML element is everything from the start tag to the end tag:

    <h1>My First Heading</h1>
    <p>My first paragraph.</p>
    Start tag	Element content	End tag
    <h1>	My First Heading	</h1>
    <p>	My first paragraph.	</p>
    <br>	none	none

    A simple text editor is all you need to learn HTML.


    Learn HTML Using Notepad or TextEdit
    Web pages can be created and modified by using professional HTML editors.
    However, for learning HTML we recommend a simple text editor like Notepad (PC) or TextEdit (Mac).
    We believe in that using a simple text editor is a good way to learn HTML.
    Follow the steps below to create your first web page with Notepad or TextEdit.
    
    Step 1: Open Notepad (PC)
    Windows 8 or later:
    Open the Start Screen (the window symbol at the bottom left on your screen). Type Notepad.
    Windows 7 or earlier:
    Open Start > Programs > Accessories > Notepad
    
    Step 1: Open TextEdit (Mac)
    Open Finder > Applications > TextEdit
    Also change some preferences to get the application to save files correctly. In Preferences > Format > choose "Plain Text"
    Then under "Open and Save", check the box that says "Display HTML files as HTML code instead of formatted text".
    Then open a new document to place the code.

    Step 2: Write Some HTML
    Write or copy the following HTML code into Notepad:

    Step 3: Save the HTML Page
    Save the file on your computer. Select File > Save as in the Notepad menu.
    Name the file "index.htm" and set the encoding to UTF-8 (which is the preferred encoding for HTML files).

    Step 4: View the HTML Page in Your Browser
    Open the saved HTML file in your favorite browser (double click on the file, or right-click - and choose "Open with").
