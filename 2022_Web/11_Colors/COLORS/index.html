      HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language, which is the most widely used
      language on Web to develop web pages. HTML was created by Berners-Lee in
      late 1991 but "HTML 2.0" was the first standard HTML specification which
      was published in 1995. HTML 4.01 was a major version of HTML and it was
      published in late 1999. Though HTML 4.01 version is widely used but
      currently we are having HTML-5 version which is an extension to HTML 4.01,
      and this version was published in 2012.
